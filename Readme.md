To create a free-tier AWS EC2 instance using Terraform, you need to follow these general steps. Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account:** Make sure you have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free-tier account at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

2. **Terraform Installed:** Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **Terraform Installation Issue** Install Docker on your local machine. you can download it from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

4. **Docker Account** If you want to push your data/images on DockerHub then create a account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup) 

Here are the steps to create an EC2 instance using Terraform on Docker:

### Step 1: Install OS in Docker 

To install the operating system in Docker, either use Docker commands or create a docker.yml file. In the file, write a script specifying the image you want to install. For example:

```bash
version: '3'
services:
  terraform:
    image: ubuntu
    command: /bin/sh -c "tail -f /dev/null"
```

To connect with Docker, use the command: docker exec <container_id> <command>.

### Step 2: Create a Terraform Configuration File

Create a new file, for example, `main.tf`, and add the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Set your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # AWS Linux 2 AMI (free tier eligible)
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  # AWS free tier eligible instance type

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

In the `provider` block, set the desired AWS region.

In the `resource "aws_instance"` block, specify the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and instance type. The example uses a free-tier eligible AMI and instance type.

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Open a terminal in the directory where your `main.tf` file is located and run:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command initializes the working directory and downloads the necessary provider plugins.

### Step 4: Preview Changes

Run the following command to see what changes Terraform will make:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Step 5: Apply Changes

If the plan looks good, apply the changes with:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type "yes" when prompted to confirm.

### Step 6: Destroy Resources (Optional)

To destroy the created resources when you no longer need them, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Type "yes" when prompted to confirm.

Remember to manage your resources responsibly, and be aware of any potential charges associated with AWS resources outside of the free tier limits.
